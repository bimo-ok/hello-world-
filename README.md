# hello-world-

I am new to Git and im trying to learn how to code.

Im learning this code for a game on- i dont want to share that.

Im still fairly young so eeeeeeeeeeee.

I believe i can do this, but it will take time.

I have a month left from my next lesson so i have a good amount of time.

But the last time i tried to learn code it took a couple months so wish me luck!
